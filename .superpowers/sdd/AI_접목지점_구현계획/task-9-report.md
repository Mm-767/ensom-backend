# Task 9 Report — Safe AI Classification Observability

## Delivered

- Added fixed-name, low-cardinality meters for calls, latency, tokens, review outcomes, purge/delete counts, and retention lag.
- Instrumented OpenAI terminal outcomes and usage, consent/rollout gates, orchestration budget/busy skips, review writer results, and retention processing.
- Published user answer/PATCH review metrics through `@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)`; rollback does not increment counters.
- Kept actuator public exposure limited to health. Prometheus scrape remains a private-ingress deployment concern documented in the runbook.
- Set fail-closed pinned OpenAI rollout defaults across application YAML, `.env.example`, and both Compose files; no secret is committed.

## Verification

- RED observed for missing metric facade, gate/orchestrator/writer/retention wiring, and after-commit EventService behavior.
- Focused: `*AiClassificationMetricsTest`, `*AiClassificationConfigurationTest`, `*AiReviewMetricsAfterCommitTest`, `*EventClassificationReviewRetentionMetricsTest` — PASS.
- Adjacent classification/review/retention/calendar regression suite — PASS.
- Full `./gradlew test` — PASS.
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config -q` and local Compose counterpart — PASS.

## Independent review follow-up

- Added JDK HTTP timeout recognition and classified incomplete responses before validating optional completed-response shape.
- Retention counters now increment after each successful `REQUIRES_NEW` batch; lag records only real overdue backlog beyond the retention cutoff.
- Writer review outcomes use the existing `AFTER_COMMIT` event listener, including a failed writer transaction regression.
- Removed calendar sync identifiers from failure logs and added an output-capture privacy regression.
- Expanded the forced-tracked runbook with provider approval and exact rollout, rollback, and cost controls.
- Final scoped re-review: APPROVED (Critical 0, Important 0).
